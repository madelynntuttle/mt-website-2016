                            p Christ Episcopal Church has been a mainstay of Christian faith throughout Northeast Florida for over 75 years. Their three campuses participate in joyful worship and provide service and educational opportunities to the community. Their previous website was complicated to update and users had difficultly finding the information they needed. Through an extensive site architecture overhaul and a new CMS these issue were resolved. The new websiteâ€™s look and feel and usability welcome new and previous members with easy-to-access information. #[a.visit(href='http://www.christepiscopalchurch.org/' target='_blank') Visit Website]
